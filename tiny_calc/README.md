# tiny calculator in rust
adapted from https://gist.github.com/dabeaz/fb823dc9564f4b140c3badd630db3652
the version implemented in this project makes little to no attempt to manage memory effectively. It makes liberal use of copy and clone.
Error handling was added after the fact and sort of works
This is definitely not idiomatic rust.
